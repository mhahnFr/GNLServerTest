# Welcome to 42cursus/get_next_line Server Tester!
To use this tester just clone it into the folder containing your ``get_next_line``. You can also edit the path to your ``get_next_line`` in the Makefile. To run this tester, simply type ``make`` inside of the ``src`` folder of the tester. As of now, it tests only the madatory part. Tests for the bonus part might be appended in the future. Please note: In order to run the server, you need to have a Java Runtime Environment or a Java Development Kit in version 8 or higher.

## Further informations
You can also run the server application on another computer, to do so, edit the ``IP_ADDRESS`` and the ``PORT_NO`` variables in the Makefile to fit your needs. Please note: As of now, you need to provide an IPv4 address, a URL is not working (see issue [#10](https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/GNLServerTest/issues/10)). Then you need to run ``make noServer`` inside the ``src`` folder of the tester.
