# Welcome to 42cursus/get_next_line Server Tester!
In order to get started, you need to modify the variable ``GET_NEXT_LINE_PATH``
in the Makefile to the **absolute path** to your ``get_next_line`` folder. You
run the tester by simply typing ``make`` inside the folder of the tester.

## Further informations
You can also run the server application on another computer, to do so, edit the
``IP_ADDRESS`` and the ``PORT_NO`` variables in the Makefile to fit your needs.
Please note: As of now, you need to provide an IPv4 address, a URL is not
working (see issue #10). Then you need to run ``make noServer`` inside the
folder of the tester.
